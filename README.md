Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent
challenges in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early detection and
intervention play a crucial role in improving the outcomes for individuals with ASD. In recent
years, there has been a growing interest in utilizing machine learning techniques to aid in the
early diagnosis and detection of ASD. This project aims to develop a novel ASD detection
technique using machine learning algorithms.
The proposed technique involves the collection of various data modalities, including
behavioral, demographic, and medical information, from individuals suspected of having ASD.
These data are combined and preprocessed to extract meaningful features that capture the
underlying characteristics associated with ASD. Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
techniques are employed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the subsequent machine
learning models.
Several machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, support vector machines, random
forests, and deep neural networks, are investigated and compared to identify the most accurate
and reliable model for ASD detection. The models are trained on a carefully curated dataset
comprising both ASD and typically developing individuals to enable accurate classification.
The evaluation of the developed ASD detection technique involves assessing its performance
in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC-ROC). Cross-validation and independent testing are conducted to ensure the
robustness and generalizability of the proposed technique.
Furthermore, the project focuses on the interpretability of the machine learning models to gain
insights into the underlying factors contributing to the classification decisions. This
interpretability aspect is crucial for understanding the discriminative features and potential
biomarkers associated with ASD, leading to improved understanding and knowledge of the
disorder.
